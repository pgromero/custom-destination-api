This is a pure javascript, zero-dependencies minimal example of a Custom API
implementation that does nothing, but exercises most of the features of the
protocol. It's useful for learning the Custom API protocol at a low level, or
for rapidly deploying without requiring a build process or dependency
management, but the other examples may be better jumping-off points for
developing a maintainable Custom API implementation.
